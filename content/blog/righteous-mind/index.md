## TLDR

- Dont live in a moral Matrix, where you are blind to the other side
- Good people make decisions based on their moral taste receptors. They may weigh the moral domains different then you.

## Opening Credits

- righteous minds made it possible for us to form groups, also guarantees that we will have differences
- dont really want world peace, want a world where people are able to have different opinions, but are controlled so they dont hurt others
- we are all self righteous hypocrites - MATT 7 - "take log out of own eye"

> The Perfect Way is only difficult for those who pick and choose; Do not like, do not dislike; all will then be clear. Make a hairbreadth difference, and Heaven and Earth are set apart; If you want the truth to stand clear before you, never be for or against. The struggle between 'for' and 'against' is the mind's worst disease;” - Sengcan - Chinese philospher - senstsan

Humans are 90% Chimpanzee and 10% Bee with the "Hive Switch" (p.223). We are mostly selfish individuals,but, when triggered, we can be very altruistic.

## Chapter 1

### Where does morality come from?

- children recognize that rules that prevent harm are special and unalterable (moral rules vs conventional social rules)
- well educated citizens in different countries are more alike to each other, rather than their poor counterparts  - study that looked at several countries across different classes
- in bathroom stall -
    - son: what would happen if i pooped in the uranal?
    - dad: it would be yucky
    - son: what would happen if i pooped in the sink?
    - dad: the people working here would get mad at you
    - son: what would happen if i pooped in the sink at home?
    - dad: mom would get mad at you
    - son: what if you pooped int he sink at home?
    - dad: mom would get mad at me
    - son: what if we all pooped in the sink?
    - dad: we would all get in trouble
- son is probing to remove the punisher - the dad is left relying on some cosmic justice to promote good behavior

## Chapter 2

### Intuitive dog and its rational tail

- doesnt matter how 'reasoned' our argument is, we need to appeal to the emotions (elephant)
- need to see from that persons angle, and when you do see it it might open us up
- empathy is an antidote to righteousness, but hard to empathize across a moral divide
- Reason vs Intuition (emotions)
    - Plato - Reason rules over all
    - Jefferson - Equal partners
        - Wrote love letter to Maria Cosway
            - the mind and heart are given different dominions and work together
    - Hume - reason is servant of passions

1. Mind is divided into parts liek rider and elphant
2. Rider serves elephant
    1. strong moral intuition that something is wrong (stories where no harm was done, but still ppl clinged to feeling that it was wrong e.g. consensual incest, man with frozen chicken)
    2. but even when trying to put a reason to it they cant, they still cling to intuition
3. social intuition model is humes model but adds social element
    1. we try to find a way to win friends and influence people
    2. intuition first, strategic reasoning second
4. talk to elephant first
    1. if you target rider first, they will find a reason to not listen

## Chapter 3

### Elephants rule

> It is easy to see the faults of others, but difficult to see one’s own faults. One shows the faults of others like chaff winnowed in the wind, but one conceals one’s own faults as a cunning gambler conceals his dice - Buddha?

- Wife asked him to not put dishes on counter - he immediately came up with an excuse
    - Intuitions come first, reasoning comes second
- Affective Primacy
    - The phenomenon of feeling (and reacting) before appraising and evaluating a situation

Morality Primacy Research

- Stood on corner and had ppl take survey about controversial topics
- stood right next to a trash can, sprayed fart spray
- **People made harsher judgments when in foul air**
- Washing hards before filling out questionnaire caused people to become more moralistic
    - when we are clean - we want to keep clean

Babies feel but dont reason

- puppet show - helper and hinder puppet
- babies choose the helper puppet when given option
- "capacity to evaluate people on basis of social interactions is universal and unlearned"

Elephant leans

- elephant intuitively leans to a side, rider looks for way to make a reason for that movement
- given a 'cool down' period, the elephant will settle back to center

## Chapter 4

### Vote for me

Chapter points:

1. reason is designed to find justification not truth
2. people care more about perception, than by reality

- important principle in designing an ethical society - **make sure the reputation is on the line, all the time** - so bad behavior always brings bad consequences
- we are good at holding people accountable in society and navigating a society where we will be held accountable

- Our reason is like a press secretary for the president - the rider finds an excuse for the elephant to get what it wants

- 2,4,6 Research Expirement
    - told the numbers 2,4,6 follow a pattern
    - generate new triplet, ask if it matches the pattern
    - give numbers:
        - 6,8,10 - they guess the pattern as - must be up even numbers up by 2
        - researcher says no
        - 5,7,9 - they guess the pattern as - must be any numbers up by 2
        - researcher say no
    - little trouble generating hypothesis about the rule they thought
    - hardly ever gave a triplet that didnt conform to their hypothesis
        - 2,4,3 - would have helped them figure out the pattern
    - Confirmation Bias - seek out reason for what you already believe

England MP

- they are able to get funds to buy a second home so they can be at primary residence and in London
- turned into a 'blank check' and would get large homes - renovate them - sell them - etc..
- expenses were not public - so they thought they would be 'hidden'

Plausible Deniability

- cashier gives them too much money - only 30% spoke up
- cashier gives them too much money-  asked if its correct - 60% said no
    - would take a direct lie to keep the money, so more ppl were ethical

Addictive Partisan

- partisans brain has been reinforced to enjoy thinking through issues in a way that free it from unwanted beliefs
- extreme partisanship could be literally addictive

Summary

1. we care about what others think
2. reason is a press secretary
3. with help of press secretary we can cheat and lie, and belief ourselves

## Chapter 5

### Beyond weird morality

- Ethic of divinity
    - america has a lot of battles over sacrilege.

    > is the flag just a piece of cloth? or does each flag contain something that is not material within it?

    artist submerges Crucifix in jar of own urine or smears elephant dung on an image of virgin mary. Do these works belong in art museums? can the artist tell religious christians, if you dont want to see it dont go to the museum? or does the mere existence of such works make the world dirtier, more profane and more degraded?

    if you cant see anything wrong here, try reversing the politics. imagine a conservative artist, had created these works using images of martin luther king jr and nelson mendela, instead of jesus and mary. image his intent was to mock the quasi deification on the left of so many black leaders. could such works be displayed in new york or paris without triggering angry demonstrations? might some on the left feel that museum had been polluted by racism even after the paintings were removed.

### Summary

- More to morality than harm and fairness
- Western educated industiral rich democratic (WEIRD)

1. moral domain varies across culture.
2. moral matrices bind people together and blind them to the coherence or even existence of other matrices.

## Chapter 6

### Tastebuds of the righteous mind

> Morality is nothing in the abstract nature of things, but is entirely relative to the sentiment or mental taste of each particular being, in the same manner as the distinctions of sweet and bitter, hot and cold arise from the particular feeling of each sense or organ. Moral perceptions, therefore, ought not to be classed with the operations of the understanding, but with the tastes or sentiments.

- 5 Tongue Tastebuds
    - saltiness
    - sweetness
    - bitterness
    - sourness
    - savoriness (umami)

## Chapter 7

### Moral foundations of politics

> Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound. Indeed, in this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done, in which our given human nature no longer commands respect, in which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our autonomous rational wills, repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder. - Leon Kass

Leon Kass is a bioethicist commenting on human cloning.

The foundations:

1. Care/Harm
2. Fairness/Cheating
3. Loyalty/Betratal
4. Authority/Subversion
5. Sanctity/Degradation

Left - Care and Fairness

Right - More balanced on all of them

---

## Chapter 8

### The conservative advantage

Unitarian vs Baptist sermons (Liberal and conservative)

Looking at word counts based on moral foundations. Unitarian more On care and fairness. Baptist more on sanctity and loyalty.

Community pot study

- Put in coins to invest you get return, but if you withhold and others put it you get even more.
- After the round, you can pay to punish anyone that was selfish
    - 84% ppl paid to punish
    - over time - punishing increased group participation
- When threat of punishment is removed, people behave selfishly. (Ring of gyges)

Liberals are based on 3 foundations. Conservatives appeal to all 6.

### Left:

- Care/Harm
- Liberty/Oppression
    - rights of vulnerable groups, look to government
- Fairness/Cheating
    - People should get the same amount

### Right:

- Care/Harm
- Liberty/Oppression
    - right to be left alone (libertarian)
